VST3 / AU / CLAP / Standalone **MIDI controller** for the Edirol / Roland Studio Canvas **SD-80** (32-part, USB). You compile this JUCE 9.0.1 project; the plugin talks to the hardware over the two USB MIDI ports.

**v1.8.12** by **Crimson Redstone**. Freeware. If you'd like to support the author, consider [purchasing the music](https://crimsonredstone.bandcamp.com/).

> **When in doubt, press SYNC HARDWARE.** The SD-80 is 2002 USB hardware and drops messages if you dump too fast. Mute, solo and the cassette only reach the module through **Part A USB / Part B USB** in OPTIONS.
>
> **Tested only on Windows 11, standalone and VST.** AU, CLAP and other operating systems ship in CMake and have not been hardware-tested.
>
> Changing many parameters while MIDI is playing can cause **volume spikes**. Tweaking **Multi FX** can flood the USB queue — Multi FX defaults OFF.

Patch names, bank MSB/LSB, SysEx addresses, checksum, MFX type list and CC numbers are taken from the **SD-80 Owner’s Manual** (Roland, 2002):

- Sound maps & bank select — pp. 55–62
- Mode SysEx — p. 53
- GM2 reverb/chorus SysEx — p. 63
- Native MFX SysEx — pp. 64–68
- MIDI implementation chart — p. 123  
  Decay time is **CC#75** (the chart). CC#80 is GP5 / Tone 1 Level.
- Instrument lists — pp. 95–104
- Drum lists — p. 105
- 90 MFX algorithms — pp. 80–94

Model ID `00H 48H` (shared with the SD-90). Roland checksum: `128 - (sum % 128)`.

## What it does

- 32 channel strips (Part A 1-16 / Part B 17-32)
- Native, GM2, GS, XG Lite mode switches
- Sound maps: Classical, Contemporary, Solo, Enhanced, Special 1, Special 2, User
- Categorized patch browser (category list + patch list, not one giant menu)
- Mix CCs: volume, pan, expression, reverb/chorus/delay send
- Tone CCs: cutoff 74, resonance 71, attack 73, decay 75, release 72, vibrato 76–78, portamento 65/5
- System reverb (6 GM2 types) + chorus (6 types) + 3 × 90-type MFX in grouped submenus, each with 4 knobs
- Parts default to **output assign MFX** so insertion FX actually hit the sound
- **SEL** routes a live MIDI keyboard onto that part (Follow SEL). An FL / 16-channel piano roll should use OPTIONS **Part A as-played** so channel 1 hits A1, same as the cassette. Player piano-roll colours are display-only.
- Mute / Solo, plus **MUTE ALL / UNMUTE ALL / UNSOLO ALL** on the mixer bar next to **PART A 1-16 / PART B 17-32** (Shift+mute / Shift+solo). Right-click a strip name to lock the instrument. The deep-edit list filters by map and category; the part changes only when you click a sound. Knobs are grouped: Filter, Envelope, Vibrato, Send. **SCALE** is this part's tune, twelve cents from -64 to +63
- **Sync Hardware** pushes the full 32-part state, including scale tune. USB throttle defaults to **0 ms** (off); OPTIONS can add 10–50 ms
- Drag-and-drop `.mid` / `.midi` on the **mixer** auto-assigns bank/PC/mix and sets Live MIDI to Part A as-played
- **PLAYER** tab: a short cassette on the left, the playlist filling the space under it, and the falling colour piano-roll at full height on the right. The keys stay on the busy four octaves, including while paused. **AETERNA** is On or Off. On, she glides along the incoming melody (ballet for a small step, walk or dash for a longer one, jump or somersault for a leap) and she does not teleport. **Space** plays and pauses. **POP OUT** / **FULL**. One dropped .mid loads a tape. Several arm the playlist. CLEAR empties the cassette and the playlist. LOOP: whole playlist, this song, or off. A STUDIO song mirrors here until you load a tape
- **KEYS** (square toggle next to the tabs) is an on-screen piano, off until you turn it on. With it on, the computer keyboard plays the selected part (Z is C, like FL). OPTIONS velocity curve (Linear, Soft, Loud, Fixed) shapes live MIDI and those keys, not the cassette
- Playlist (on the **PLAYER** tab, under the cassette, not its own tab): ADD and CLEAR, two deck cards (Part A / Part B) with live progress, plus the queue. The cassette PLAY / PAUSE / STOP drive it. CLEAR empties the cassette and the playlist. PLAY starts A, then they ping-pong. Send setup is locked while armed
- **STUDIO** tab: write SD-80 songs (and edit imported MIDI) without a separate DAW. 32 lanes = mixer parts. Double-click a clip to edit it (EDIT badge + roll header). Drag clip edges to resize. M / S on each lane. GLOBAL tempo / master vol / FX, folded until you open it. Point CC curves: the arrow opens lanes (right-click picks one). Click the bar ruler to move the playhead. Shift+wheel, the scrollbar, or middle-drag pans. Alt+wheel changes the velocity of the selected note. Piano roll stays inside the pattern; -/+ zoom. SAVE / LOAD `.mesd80song`. IMPORT `.mid` (one pattern per channel, mixer patches sent, lanes start folded). EXPORT Part A `.mid` (and `-B.mid` if Part B has clips). Last song comes back with skins
- **PATCH** tab: design a user tone. Four layers (on, loudness, tune, pan, velocity crossfade, through the effect or straight out). Drag filter / volume envelopes. Pick a factory base sound from a map and category list (Classical, Contemporary, Solo, Enhanced, Special 1, Special 2, User). INFO explains the controls. **SEND** on an SD-80 or SD-90 writes the part's temporary patch in Native — bank/PC first, then DT1. The module's 128 user slots only keep MFX from the panel Write Patch; this does not pretend to flash them. **SAVE / LOAD** `.mesd80patch` and the 144 local slots work for an SD-20 too (no SEND; LIVE is CC offsets, 64 = unchanged; tones 3–4 stay in the file). SYX export. Comes back with the session
- **OPTIONS**: audio I/O (real selector in standalone; greyed “Controlled by Host” in a DAW), USB ports, host MIDI route, module volume, velocity curve, computer-key velocity, Pull from SD-80, 9 skins, shortcuts, emergency reset
- Right-click any fader, knob, toggle or menu to **lock** it. Locks survive patch, MIDI import and presets
- Session total recall via `getStateInformation` / `setStateInformation`
- `.mesd80preset` XML snapshots

## Standalone ASIO

On Windows the standalone lists **ASIO** in OPTIONS → Audio (Steinberg ASIO SDK is fetched at CMake configure). Pick your interface so the SD-80 can clock out over SPDIF or whatever you use.

If the SDK zip cannot be downloaded, pass `-DASIO_SDK_DIR=C:/path/to/asiosdk` pointing at a folder that contains `common/iasiodrv.h`. Disable with `-DMESD80_ASIO=OFF`.

The standalone window is a native title bar only. There is no extra JUCE Options/Settings menu. The cassette-reel icon in `Assets/icon.png` is baked into the Windows exe / VST3 and the macOS bundle — rebuild once so the taskbar picks it up. Closing the window (X or Alt+F4) sends all-notes-off on both USB ports first so a hanging note cannot stick on the module.

## Build (you compile)

Requires **CMake 3.22+**, a C++20 compiler, and Git (JUCE **9.0.1** is fetched on first configure). If you already built with JUCE 8, delete the `build` folder once. JUCE is GPL v3 unless you have a commercial JUCE license. See `github/BUILD.md` and `github/HARDWARE.md`.

### Windows (Visual Studio 2022)

Double-click **`build.bat`**. It writes **`logs\build.log`** — paste that file if it breaks. Builds **VST3 + Standalone**, then CLAP.

```bat
cmake -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
cmake --build build --config Release --target ModernEdirolSD80_VST3 ModernEdirolSD80_Standalone ModernEdirolSD80_CLAP
```

**AU cannot be built on Windows** — Audio Units are macOS only.

CLAP uses [clap-juce-extensions](https://github.com/free-audio/clap-juce-extensions) (JUCE 9.0.1 has no native CLAP client). Skip it with `-DMESD80_CLAP=OFF`.

### macOS (Xcode / AU + VST3 + CLAP)

```bash
cmake -B build -G Xcode
cmake --build build --config Release --target ModernEdirolSD80_VST3 ModernEdirolSD80_AU ModernEdirolSD80_CLAP
```

AU copies into `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components`. CLAP copies next to the VST3 (or set your DAW's CLAP folder).

### Local JUCE instead of FetchContent

```bash
cmake -B build -DJUCE_DIR=/path/to/JUCE
```

## Hardware reminder

Read [HARDWARE.md](github/HARDWARE.md) before you panic. The module is old. Treat it like old gear.
